Installation hints:

(1) Check Makefile,
    edit CC and CFLAGS macro definition if needed.

    Preprocessor symbols which can be defined with -D in CFLAGS:

    DIR_SUPPORT  define this if you want to enable 'library list'
		 feature.

    DIRENT	 define this if your system supports <dirent.h>.
		 (DIR_SUPPORT should be defined also).

    DOS		 define this if your system is MS-DOS.
		 But only works with Microsoft C (v5.x or later)

    __STDC__	 define by yourself if your compiler is very close to
		 ANSI but too modesty not to define this.

(2) do `make'

(3) test

   % focal
   * lib call queens.foc
   * g

      ....

   If works correctly, you finally get "Total 92 answers".
